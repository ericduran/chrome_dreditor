This is an attempt to convert the Drupal Editor (http://drupal.org/project/dreditor) to a chrome extension.

This is an unpacked Chrome extension. If you want to use it you will need to go to Chrome Extensions windows and display the developer mode.
Under Developer Mode you will now have an option to "Load unpacked extension".
 
TODO:
 - Add support for Contribution Links, Developer Links, Documentation Team Links (right now they're hardcoded, got fix that).
 - Add support for Turning Dreditor on an off. (Implement using Page Action, so you can turn it on on drupal.org but it doesn't take up an icon on chrome)
 - Implement Patch review (maybe use bespin embedded)
 - Implement any other feature I miss that's currently in dreditor ;-)
