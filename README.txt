This is an attempt to convert the Drupal Editor (http://drupal.org/project/dreditor) to a chrome extension.

This is an unpacked Chrome extension. If you want to use it you will need to go to Chrome Extensions windows and display the developer mode.
Under Developer Mode you will now have an option to "Load unpacked extension".
 
TODO:
 - Implement any other feature I miss that's currently in dreditor ;-)
