This is an attempt to convert the Drupal Editor (http://drupal.org/project/dreditor) to a chrome extension.

TODO:
 - Add support for Contribution Links, Developer Links, Documentation Team Links (right now they're hardcoded, got fix that).
 - Add support for Turning Dreditor on an off. (Implement using Page Action, so you can turn it on on drupal.org but it doesn't take up an icon on chrome)
 - Implement Patch review (maybe use bespin embedded)
 - Implement any other feature I miss that's currently in dreditor ;-)
